# Greetings! 👋

I am a Computational and Data Science Educator at the University of Arizona Data Science Institute, where I develop **free and open access** statistics and open science curriculum.  

My Ph.D. dissertation, under the guidance of Dr. Anna Dornhaus, focused on how the shapes of ant nests affect how they behave, and addressed links between animal and human architectures. 

I am passionate about educating and advocate making the student the hero instead of the instructor by tailoring materials to each learner. 

### Thanks for visiting! 🤘
